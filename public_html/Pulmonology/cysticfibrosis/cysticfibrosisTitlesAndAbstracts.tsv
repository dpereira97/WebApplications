31107966	Mucolytic agents versus placebo for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume or purulence of sputum, or both. Personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations indicate that therapies that reduce the occurrence of exacerbations are likely to be useful. Mucolytics are oral medicines that are believed to increase expectoration of sputum by reducing its viscosity, thus making it easier to cough it up. Improved expectoration of sputum may lead to a reduction in exacerbations of COPD.Primary objective&#x2022; To determine whether treatment with mucolytics reduces exacerbations and/or days of disability in patients with chronic bronchitis or COPDSecondary objectives&#x2022; To assess whether mucolytics lead to improvement in lung function or quality of life&#x2022; To determine frequency of adverse effects associated with use of mucolytics SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on 12 separate occasions, most recently on 23 April 2019.We included randomised studies that compared oral mucolytic therapy versus placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.This review analysed summary data only, most derived from published studies. For earlier versions, one review author extracted data, which were rechecked in subsequent updates. In later versions, review authors double-checked extracted data and then entered data into RevMan 5.3 for analysis.We added four studies for the 2019 update. The review now includes 38 trials, recruiting a total of 10,377 participants. Studies lasted between two months and three years and investigated a range of mucolytics, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, erdosteine, and ambroxol, given at least once daily. Many studies did not clearly describe allocation concealment, and we had concerns about blinding and high levels of attrition in some studies. The primary outcomes were exacerbations and number of days of disability.Results of 28 studies including 6723 participants show that receiving mucolytics may be more likely to be exacerbation-free during the study period compared to those given placebo (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 1.91; moderate-certainty evidence). However, more recent studies show less benefit of treatment than was reported in earlier studies in this review. The overall number needed to treat with mucolytics for an average of nine months to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations was eight (NNTB 8, 95% CI 7 to 10). High heterogeneity was noted for this outcome (I&#xB2; = 62%), so results need to be interpreted with caution. The type or dose of mucolytic did not seem to alter the effect size, nor did the severity of COPD, including exacerbation history. Longer studies showed smaller effects of mucolytics than were reported in shorter studies.Mucolytic use was associated with a reduction of 0.43 days of disability per participant per month compared with use of placebo (95% CI -0.56 to -0.30; studies = 9; I&#xB2; = 61%; moderate-certainty evidence). With mucolytics, the number of people with one or more hospitalisations was reduced, but study results were not consistent (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; participants = 1788; studies = 4; I&#xB2; = 58%; moderate-certainty evidence). Investigators reported improved quality of life with mucolytics (mean difference (MD) -1.37, 95% CI -2.85 to 0.11; participants = 2721; studies = 7; I&#xB2; = 64%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the mean difference did not reach the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units, and the confidence interval includes no difference. Mucolytic treatment was associated with a possible reduction in adverse events (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94; participants = 7264; studies = 24; I&#xB2; = 46%; moderate-certainty evidence), but the pooled effect includes no difference if a random-effects model is used. Several studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis reported high numbers of adverse events, up to a mean of five events per person during follow-up. There was no clear difference between mucolytics and placebo for mortality, but the confidence interval is too wide to confirm that treatment has no effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.87; participants = 3527; studies = 11; I&#xB2; = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence).In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, we are moderately confident that treatment with mucolytics leads to a small reduction in the likelihood of having an acute exacerbation, in days of disability per month and possibly hospitalisations, but is not associated with an increase in adverse events. There appears to be limited impact on lung function or health-related quality of life. Results are too imprecise to be certain whether or not there is an effect on mortality. Our confidence in the results is reduced by high levels of heterogeneity in many of the outcomes and the fact that effects on exacerbations shown in early trials were larger than those reported by more recent studies. This may be a result of greater risk of selection or publication bias in earlier trials, thus benefits of treatment may not be as great as was suggested by previous evidence.
31107755	FDG PET/CT of Gardnerella vaginalis infection.	We report the case of a 23-year-old woman with a history of cystic fibrosis and bilung transplantation, who presented clinically cervical swollen lymph nodes with alteration of her general state. F-FDG PET/CT was performed because of lymphoma suspicion and showed cervical and pelvic hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies, with linear vaginal hypermetabolism. There was an increase of lactate dehydrogenase, and Epstein-Barr virus detection was negative. A right cervical lymph node biopsy was performed, with no lymphoma involvement. Complementary microbiological investigations showed positive results for Gardnerella vaginalis. F-FDG PET/CT lymphatic node hypermetabolism is not specific to lymphoma, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
31107753	Metastatic Extramammary Paget Disease of the Perianal Region.	A 72-year-old man with history of itching for 8 months presented with an ill-defined, ulcerated, eczematous, thickened cutaneous lesion in the left perianal region. F-FDG PET/CT was performed, and neoplastic skin thickening with FDG uptake was seen at the left gluteal cleft. Hypermetabolic inguinal, retroperitoneal, and mediastinal lymph nodes, liver, and bone metastases were seen. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the perianal growth and left inguinal lymph node were positive for cytokeratin7 and gross cystic disease fluid protein and negative for cytokeratin 20 and CDX2, confirming the diagnosis of primary extramammary Paget disease with metastases.
31107611	High-Throughput Surface Liquid Absorption and Secretion Assays to Identify F508del CFTR Correctors Using Patient Primary Airway Epithelial Cultures.	High-throughput screening for drug discovery is increasingly utilizing cellular systems of high physiological relevance, such as patient primary cells and organoid cultures. We used 3D-cultured cystic fibrosis patient bronchial epithelial cells to screen for new small-molecule correctors of the disease-causing F508del mutation in CFTR. Impaired mucociliary clearance due to insufficient airway hydration is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis and we used a simple measure of surface liquid levels to quantify F508del CFTR correction in cultured bronchial epithelial cells. Two robust assay formats were configured and used to screen more than 100,000 compounds as mixtures or individual compounds in 96-well format. The corrector discovery success rate, as measured by the number of hits confirmed by an electrophysiology assay on patient primary bronchial epithelial cells, was superior to screens in cell lines expressing recombinant F508del CFTR. Several novel corrector scaffolds were discovered that when combined with the clinical corrector VX-809 delivered combination responses greater than double that of VX-809 alone. This work exemplifies the advantages of a disease-relevant readout and 3D-cultured patient primary cells for the discovery of new drug candidates.
31107204	Sequence similarity searches for morphine biosynthesis enzymes in bacteria yield putative targets for understanding associations between infection and opiate administration.	Exploiting the immunosuppressive, analgesic and highly addictive properties of morphine could increase the success of a bacterial pathogen. Therefore, we performed sequence similarity searches for two morphine biosynthesis demethylases in bacteria. For thebaine 6-O-demethylase and codeine O-demethylase, we found strong alignments to three (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii) of the six ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) that are commonly associated with drug resistance and nosocomial infections. Expression of the aligned sequence found in P. aeruginosa (NP_252880.1/PA4191) is upregulated in isolates obtained from cystic fibrosis patients. Our findings provide putative mechanistic targets for understanding the role of morphine in pathogenicity.
31107040	Macro- and microvascular functions in cystic fibrosis adults without cardiovascular risk factors: A case-control study.	Increasing survival from cystic fibrosis show untypical systems involvement, such as cardiocirculatory. In particular, the presence of CFTR in smooth muscle and endothelial cells, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress could explain vascular alterations in these patients. We aimed at noninvasely evaluating macro- and microvascular dysfunction in cystic fibrosis adults without cardiovascular risk factors. Twenty-twoadults affected by cystic fibrosis and 24 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex were enrolled. None had known cardiovascular risk factors. All people underwent blood pressure measurement, microvascular function assessment by EndoPAT-2000 device (calculating RH-PAT index) and macrovascular evaluation by pulse wave velocity (PWV). RH-PAT index was significantly lower in patients than in controls (1.74&#xB1;0.59 vs 2.33&#xB1;0.34; p&lt;0.001). Thirteen patients of 22 had a value inferior to the threshold of 1.67 (59.1%), while no controls had (p&lt;0.001). Carotid-femoral PWV did not differ between the two groups (5.2&#xB1;1.5 m/s vs 5.4&#xB1;1.1; p=0.9), while brachial-ankle one did (11.0&#xB1;2.2 m/s vs 10.1&#xB1;0.8 m/s; p=0.04).Adults patients affected by cystic fibrosis show peripheral endothelial dysfunction, which is the first alteration in atherosclerotic phenomenon. Moreover, arterial stiffness measured by PWV unclearly seems to differ respect of healthy people, perhaps because PWV alterations are typical of above 50 years old people. It is unclear what prognostic role of future developing of atherosclerotic disease these findings could be, but it seems evident that cystic fibrosis directly affects cardiovascular system itself.
31106941	Pulse granuloma presenting as a complex pelvic cyst.	Pulse granuloma, a benign granulomatous lesion, develops due to foreign body reactions to food particles. This rare entity occurs occasionally in the abdominal cavity. However, it has never been reported as a pelvic mass or a recurrent case. A 37-year-old woman with a medical history of pelvic granulomatous lesions treated in Thailand, was admitted for abdominal pain. Imaging study revealed a pelvic complex cyst and disseminated nodules. Ovarian cancer or tuberculous peritonitis was suspected. The appearance at laparotomy was an inflammatory mass encased in adhesions; therefore, only biopsy was performed. The pathology diagnosis was pulse granuloma. The pathology report from Thailand was obtained only after her discharge, suggesting that the previous granulomatous lesion contained vegetable matter. This report demonstrates that pulse granuloma can present as a pelvic mass and may relapse. For complex cystic lesions with solid components in the pelvis, pulse granuloma should be considered as a differential diagnosis.
31106528	Cystic fibrosis year in review 2018, part 1.	Cystic fibrosis research and case reports were robust in the year 2018. This report summarizes research and cases related to Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies, inflammation and infection, epidemiology and the physiologic, and imaging assessment of disease.
31106078	Presentation Patterns, Diagnostic Modalities, Management Strategies, and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Hydatid Disease of the Pelvic Bone: A Comparative Review of 31 Cases.	Hydatid disease is a parasitic zoonosis commonly caused by . It&#xA0;characteristically involves the liver and the lungs but rare occurrences in other organs have also been reported. Bone involvement is distinctly uncommon, which is predominantly a silent and slowly progressive disease with a long latent period. We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, and Scopus databases. After a comprehensive review of the search results, a total of 31 cases of hydatid disease of the pelvic bone fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The data on patient&#xA0;demographics, epidemiology, lesion site, management, clinical outcomes, and follow-up were collected and analyzed. This review illustrates that hydatid disease should be considered among the differential diagnoses of unusual cystic lesions of the pelvic bone. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are of paramount importance to prevent bone destruction and serious complications in these patients. Long-term follow-up should be performed for potential recurrence.
31105667	Anti-pseudomonad Activity of Manuka Honey and Antibiotics in a Specialized ex vivo Model Simulating Cystic Fibrosis Lung Infection.	 causes problematic chronic lung infections in those suffering from cystic fibrosis. This is due to its antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and its ability to form robust biofilm communities with increased antimicrobial tolerances. Using novel antimicrobials or repurposing current ones is required in order to overcome these problems. Manuka honey is a natural antimicrobial agent that has been used for many decades in the treatment of chronic surface wounds with great success, particularly those infected with . Here we aim to determine whether the antimicrobial activity of manuka honey could potentially be repurposed to inhibit pulmonary  infections using two  models.  isolates ( = 28) from an international panel were tested for their susceptibility to manuka honey and clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin), alone and in combination, using conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). To increase clinical applicability, two  porcine lung (EVPL) models (using alveolar and bronchiolar tissue) were used to determine the anti-biofilm effects of manuka honey alone and in combination with antibiotics. All  isolates were susceptible to manuka honey, however, varying incidences of resistance were seen against antibiotics. The combination of sub-inhibitory manuka honey and antibiotics using conventional AST had no effect on activity against the majority of isolates tested. Using the two  models, 64% (w/v) manuka honey inhibited many of the isolates where abnormally high concentrations of antibiotics could not. Typically, combinations of both manuka honey and antibiotics had increased antimicrobial activity. These results highlight the potential of manuka honey as a future antimicrobial for the treatment of pulmonary  isolates, clearing potential infection reservoirs within the upper airway.
