31108218	A comparison of leukotriene receptor antagonists to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids in elderly mild asthmatics.	Although elderly asthma patients have different clinical characteristics from young adults, few studies or guidelines have focused on specific treatments for this population.This study compared the effectiveness of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) versus inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in elderly asthma patients in real-world settings.We extracted records for elderly asthma patients who were newly prescribed LTRAs or low-dose ICSs from January 2003 to December 2010 from National Sample Cohort data of Korea. We defined the first prescription date for each medication as the index date. We compared the risks of asthma exacerbation between the two groups using Cox proportional-hazard regression after propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to balance covariates between treatment groups. We also compared asthma-related healthcare resource utilization and medication compliance in both groups using chi-squared test and t-tests.The number of identified patients newly treated with LTRAs and low-dose ICSs was 1,571 and 121, respectively. The risks of asthma exacerbation in the LTRA and low-dose ICS groups after weighting were not significantly different (hazard ratio: 0.96; 95 % CI: 0.73-1.26). The proportion with high-compliance (MPR &#x2265; 80 %) in the LTRA group was higher than that in the low-dose ICS group.The effectiveness of LTRAs was not different from that of low-dose ICSs regarding the risk of asthma exacerbation in elderly asthma patients in real-world settings. Given the practical benefits gained from convenient administration, LTRA can be considered a reasonable alternative first-line therapy for elderly patients with mild asthma.

31107966	Mucolytic agents versus placebo for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume or purulence of sputum, or both. Personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations indicate that therapies that reduce the occurrence of exacerbations are likely to be useful. Mucolytics are oral medicines that are believed to increase expectoration of sputum by reducing its viscosity, thus making it easier to cough it up. Improved expectoration of sputum may lead to a reduction in exacerbations of COPD.Primary objective&#x2022; To determine whether treatment with mucolytics reduces exacerbations and/or days of disability in patients with chronic bronchitis or COPDSecondary objectives&#x2022; To assess whether mucolytics lead to improvement in lung function or quality of life&#x2022; To determine frequency of adverse effects associated with use of mucolytics SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on 12 separate occasions, most recently on 23 April 2019.We included randomised studies that compared oral mucolytic therapy versus placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis.This review analysed summary data only, most derived from published studies. For earlier versions, one review author extracted data, which were rechecked in subsequent updates. In later versions, review authors double-checked extracted data and then entered data into RevMan 5.3 for analysis.We added four studies for the 2019 update. The review now includes 38 trials, recruiting a total of 10,377 participants. Studies lasted between two months and three years and investigated a range of mucolytics, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, erdosteine, and ambroxol, given at least once daily. Many studies did not clearly describe allocation concealment, and we had concerns about blinding and high levels of attrition in some studies. The primary outcomes were exacerbations and number of days of disability.Results of 28 studies including 6723 participants show that receiving mucolytics may be more likely to be exacerbation-free during the study period compared to those given placebo (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 1.91; moderate-certainty evidence). However, more recent studies show less benefit of treatment than was reported in earlier studies in this review. The overall number needed to treat with mucolytics for an average of nine months to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations was eight (NNTB 8, 95% CI 7 to 10). High heterogeneity was noted for this outcome (I&#xB2; = 62%), so results need to be interpreted with caution. The type or dose of mucolytic did not seem to alter the effect size, nor did the severity of COPD, including exacerbation history. Longer studies showed smaller effects of mucolytics than were reported in shorter studies.Mucolytic use was associated with a reduction of 0.43 days of disability per participant per month compared with use of placebo (95% CI -0.56 to -0.30; studies = 9; I&#xB2; = 61%; moderate-certainty evidence). With mucolytics, the number of people with one or more hospitalisations was reduced, but study results were not consistent (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; participants = 1788; studies = 4; I&#xB2; = 58%; moderate-certainty evidence). Investigators reported improved quality of life with mucolytics (mean difference (MD) -1.37, 95% CI -2.85 to 0.11; participants = 2721; studies = 7; I&#xB2; = 64%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the mean difference did not reach the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units, and the confidence interval includes no difference. Mucolytic treatment was associated with a possible reduction in adverse events (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94; participants = 7264; studies = 24; I&#xB2; = 46%; moderate-certainty evidence), but the pooled effect includes no difference if a random-effects model is used. Several studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis reported high numbers of adverse events, up to a mean of five events per person during follow-up. There was no clear difference between mucolytics and placebo for mortality, but the confidence interval is too wide to confirm that treatment has no effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.87; participants = 3527; studies = 11; I&#xB2; = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence).In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, we are moderately confident that treatment with mucolytics leads to a small reduction in the likelihood of having an acute exacerbation, in days of disability per month and possibly hospitalisations, but is not associated with an increase in adverse events. There appears to be limited impact on lung function or health-related quality of life. Results are too imprecise to be certain whether or not there is an effect on mortality. Our confidence in the results is reduced by high levels of heterogeneity in many of the outcomes and the fact that effects on exacerbations shown in early trials were larger than those reported by more recent studies. This may be a result of greater risk of selection or publication bias in earlier trials, thus benefits of treatment may not be as great as was suggested by previous evidence.
31107766	Caring for the Transgender Adolescent: It Takes a Village.	Christa is a 15-year-old male-to-female (MTF) transgender patient who comes to your Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics office for consultation on attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) management and concerns about worsening anxiety. Review of medical history included mild persistent asthma managed with steroid inhaler and leukotriene antagonist. She was diagnosed with ADHD at 12 years and has been placed on methylphenidate and clonidine over the years with little improvement. She struggles in school, with barely passing grades, and feels that she cannot focus on her assignments.She was diagnosed with MTF transition gender dysphoria, social anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder at 13 years by a psychiatrist and was treated with sertraline with some mood improvement. More recently, she reports having thoughts of wanting to hurt people and "wanting to watch them wither away." She expressed being terrified by these thoughts, which lasted for a couple of days but have since resolved. She denied any suicidal thoughts recently and gives credit to her "best girlfriend" for her overall improved mood, improved sleep pattern, and increased energy level. She expressed having deepening feelings for this girlfriend but admitted to not having acted on these feelings as she is afraid of the consequences. She currently uses the pronouns she/her/hers.Family history is pertinent for paternal bipolar disorder. There is considerable psychosocial stress as Christa is estranged from her father, who is not supportive of her transition, although mother is. Unfortunately, she is dependent on her father for medical insurance coverage, and he is refusing to give authorization to proceed with the evaluations and diagnostic workup for the transformation. Christa has been repeatedly encouraged to seek counseling but has declined because of previous poor experiences with counselors. Her primary care clinician in Family Medicine has been administering hormonal replacement therapy because she cannot access the regional center of excellence because of above-mentioned insurance issues. She presents to you now with her mother for management suggestions and diagnostic clarification. What is your next step?
31106879	Risk of severe maternal morbidity in relation to prepregnancy body mass index: Roles of maternal co-morbidities and caesarean birth.	An association between prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) has been reported, but evidence has been mixed and potential explanations have not been examined.To evaluate the association between prepregnancy BMI and SMM in a large, diverse birth cohort and assess potential mediation by obesity-related co-morbidities and caesarean birth.This cohort study used linked birth certificate and hospitalisation discharge records from Californian births during 2007-2012. We assessed associations between prepregnancy BMI and SMM, and used inverse probability weighting for multiple mediators to estimate relative and absolute natural direct and indirect effects accounting for mediation by co-morbidities (hypertensive conditions, diabetes, asthma) and caesarean birth.Among 2&#xA0;650&#xA0;182 births, the prevalence of SMM was 1.42%. Adjusted risk ratios for the total association between prepregnancy BMI category and SMM were 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07, 1.18) for underweight, 1.02 (95% CI 0.99, 1.04) for overweight, 1.04 (95% CI 1.00, 1.07) for obesity class 1, 1.14 (95% CI 1.09, 1.20) for obesity class 2, and 1.28 (95% CI 1.22, 1.36) for obesity class 3 compared to women with normal weight. After accounting for mediation by co-morbidity and caesarean birth, the risk ratios were 1.19 (95% CI 1.14, 1.26) for underweight, 0.91 (95% CI 0.89, 0.94) for overweight, 0.86 (95% CI 0.84, 0.89) for obesity class 1, 0.88 (95% CI 0.84, 0.92) for obesity class 2, and 0.89 (95% CI 0.83, 0.95) for obesity class 3.Co-morbidities and caesarean birth explained an association between high prepregnancy BMI and SMM. These findings suggest that promotion of healthy prepregnancy weight, along with management of co-morbidities and support of vaginal birth in pregnant women with high BMI, could reduce the risk of SMM. However, these mediators did not reduce the elevated risk of SMM observed in women with low BMI.
31106621	Female-specific risk factors associated with risk of ACO (Asthma COPD Overlap) in Aboriginal People.	Sex differences in incidence, susceptibility and severity of many chronic respiratory diseases have been long recognized. Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO) is newly recognised disease with its management guidelines reported in 2015. The objective of this analysis is to identify the female-specific risk factors associated with ACO in Aboriginal people.The Aboriginal Peoples Survey 2012 (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;28,410) is the fourth cycle of a national cross-sectional survey representative of the First Nations living off reserve, Metis and Inuit. The 2012 APS collected information on employment, education, health status, housing, family background and income. Survey Logistic Regression was used to identify the significant risk factors for ACO in the multivariate analysis.The prevalence of ACO was 1.65% and 3.53% in males and females respectively. The following factors were significantly associated with increased risk of ACO in both males and females: increased age, living in Quebec, longer hours of work per week, living in a rented dwelling and dwelling in need of major repairs. However, three factors including marital status (being widowed, separated or divorced), smoking status (being a current daily smoker) and having a diagnosis of diabetes were significantly associated with increased risk of ACO in females not males.The results of our study may offer useful evidence for future development of female-specific prevention and public health intervention programs in aboriginal communities to reduce the burden of ACO.
