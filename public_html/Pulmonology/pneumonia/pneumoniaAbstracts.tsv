Children with oropharyngeal dysphagia have impaired airway protection mechanisms and are at higher risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications. Aspiration of gastric contents is often implicated as a cause for these pulmonary complications, despite being supported by little evidence. The goal of this study is to determine the relative contribution of oropharyngeal and gastric microbial communities to perturbations in the lung microbiome of children with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration.We conducted a prospective cohort study of 220 patients consecutively recruited from a tertiary aerodigestive center undergoing simultaneous esophagogastroduodenoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage, gastric and oropharyngeal samples were collected from all recruited patients and 16S sequencing was performed. A subset of 104 patients also underwent video fluoroscopic swallow studies to assess swallow function and were categorized as aspiration/no aspiration. To ensure the validity of the results, we compared the microbiome of these aerodigestive patients to the microbiome of pediatric patients recruited to a longitudinal cohort study of children with suspected GERD; patients recruited to this study had oropharyngeal, gastric and/or stool samples available. The relationships between microbial communities across the aerodigestive tract were described by analyzing within- and between-patient beta diversities and identifying taxa which are exchanged between aerodigestive sites within patients. These relationships were then compared in patients with and without aspiration to evaluate the effect of aspiration on the aerodigestive microbiome.Within all patients, lung, oropharyngeal and gastric microbiomes overlap. The degree of similarity is the lowest between the oropharynx and lungs (median Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) = 0.90), and as high between the stomach and lungs as between the oropharynx and stomach (median JSD = 0.56 for both; p = 0.6). Unlike the oropharyngeal microbiome, lung and gastric communities are highly variable across people and driven primarily by person rather than body site. In patients with aspiration, the lung microbiome more closely resembles oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities and there is greater prevalence of microbial exchange between the lung and oropharynx than between gastric and lung sites (p = 0.04 and 4x10-5, respectively).The gastric and lung microbiomes display significant overlap in patients with intact airway protective mechanisms while the lung and oropharynx remain distinct. In patients with impaired swallow function and aspiration, the lung microbiome shifts towards oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities. This finding may explain why antireflux surgeries fail to show benefit in pediatric pulmonary outcomes.
This study retrospectively evaluated the safety, impact on growth, and clinical outcomes of gastrojejunostomy tubes (GJTs) converted from surgically-placed gastrostomy tubes (GTs) in 44 developmentally-disabled children (median age: 28 months). The total duration of GJT follow-up was 31,378 device-days (median:643 device-days). Three major complications (aspiration pneumonia) were identified in 3 patients (6.8%), 63 minor complications in 31 patients (70.5%), and 202 tube maintenance issues (TMIs) in 41 patients (93.2%). A significantly increased average change in weight-for-age z-scores was observed at each 6-month interval that continued past 25 months. Patients above the median rate of TMIs had marginally significant lower z-scores across the study period (p&#x200A;=&#x200A;.06), compared to those below the median rate. GJTs were removed in six patients (13.6%) because of adequate oral intake at last follow-up. Conversion from GTs to GJTs was a viable option to achieve sustained growth in developmentally-disabled children. Frequency of TMIs may negatively impact their growth.
Diagnostic testing and antibiotics are not routinely recommended for young children with community-acquired pneumonia. In a national sample of &gt;6 million outpatient 1- to 6-year-olds with community-acquired pneumonia between 2008 and 2015, a complete blood count was obtained for 8.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1%-11.1%), radiography was performed for 43% (95% CI, 36%-50%), and antibiotics were given for 73.9% (95% CI, 67.1%-80.7%). There were no changes in testing or antibiotic use over time.
Universal vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines has significantly changed the epidemiology of invasive H. influenzae disease in the United States. We reviewed the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes in 61 patients with invasive H. influenzae disease evaluated at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH).Cases of invasive H. influenzae disease, defined as isolation of the organism from cerebrospinal fluid, blood, synovial fluid or pleural fluid, during 2011 to 2018 among children cared for at TCH in Houston, TX, were included.We identified 61 cases of invasive H. influenzae disease in children &#x2264;18 years of age. The overall hospitalization rate due to invasive H. influenzae disease increased between 2011 and 2018 (0 vs. 0.64/1000 hospitalizations; P = 0.019). The majority (80%) of infections occurred in children &lt;5 years of age. Of the 61 H. influenzae infections, 24 (39.3%) infections were caused by nontypeable H. influenzae strains, 18 (29.5%) infections were caused by H. influenzae type a, 12 (19.7%) infections were caused by H. influenzae type f, 3 (4.9%) infections were caused by H. influenzae type e and 4 (6.6%) isolates were not typed. A total of 78.7% of the isolates were &#x3B2;-lactamase negative. The most common clinical presentations were bacteremia without a source, pneumonia and meningitis.The hospitalization rate for H. influenzae invasive disease increased over an 8-year period at TCH. The overall trend was mainly driven by an increasing number of invasive infections caused by nontypeable H. influenzae and H. influenzae type a. Morbidity was substantial, especially in meningitis cases.
Postoperative pneumonia is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery, and its diagnosis is difficult. Little is known about the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the detection of pneumonia in cardiac surgical patients. The substitution of chest radiography by colour Doppler LUS (LUS-sCPIS) in the simplified clinical pulmonary infection score (sCPIS) could improve the diagnosis of pneumonia following cardiac surgery.The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of LUS-sCPIS and of sCPIS alone in the detection of postoperative pneumonia after cardiac surgery.A prospective study of diagnostic accuracy.A Surgical Intensive Care Unit of a French University Hospital.Fifty-one patients with acute respiratory failure within 72&#x200A;h after cardiac surgery were enrolled between January and May 2015.The two index tests, LUS-sCPIS and sCPIS, were calculated for all patients at the onset of acute respiratory failure. The reference standard for the diagnosis of pneumonia was based on the consensus of three physicians, blind to the sCPIS and LUS-sCPIS data, based on a posthoc review of all the clinical, radiological and microbiological evidence. The diagnostic accuracy of LUS-sCPIS was compared with that of sCPIS in the detection of postoperative pneumonia.Pneumonia was diagnosed in 26 out of 51 patients. The LUS-sCPIS detected the presence of pneumonia with a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 0.85 to 0.99) and a specificity of 68% (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81). The sCPIS detected the presence of pneumonia with a sensitivity of 35% (95% CI 0.22 to 0.48) and a specificity of 84% (95% CI 0.74 to 0.94). The area under the curve (AUC) of LUS-sCPIS at 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.91) was higher than the AUC of sCPIS at 0.59 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.71; P&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.0008).Compared with sCPIS, LUS-sCPIS improved diagnostic accuracy in the detection of postoperative pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory failure after cardiac surgery. It could be a useful bedside tool to guide pneumonia management.Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03279887.
For most bacterial pneumonia, the lung interstitium is considered to be the site of infection, and adequate antibiotic concentrations are important for drug effectDespite systemic antibiotic therapy, therapeutic failure is common, perhaps due to poor lung penetration, and resulting low interstitial space fluid antibiotic concentrationsIncreasing systemic antibiotic doses in order to increase interstitial space fluid antibiotic concentrations could lead to toxicities such as nephrotoxicity WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In a mechanically ventilated healthy large animal model, nebulized tobramycin produced higher peak lung interstitial space fluid concentrations, as well as higher initial epithelial lining fluid concentrations, with lower plasma concentrations than were observed after intravenous administration due to more extensive lung penetration BACKGROUND:: Nebulized antibiotics may be used to treat ventilator-associated pneumonia. In previous pharmacokinetic studies, lung interstitial space fluid concentrations have never been reported. The aim of the study was to compare intravenous and nebulized tobramycin concentrations in the lung interstitial space fluid, epithelial lining fluid, and plasma in mechanically ventilated sheep with healthy lungs.Ten anesthetized and mechanically ventilated healthy ewes underwent surgical insertion of microdialysis catheters in upper and lower lobes of both lungs and the jugular vein. Five ewes were given intravenous tobramycin 400 mg, and five were given nebulized tobramycin 400 mg. Microdialysis samples were collected every 20 min for 8 h. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at 1 and 6 h.The peak lung interstitial space fluid concentrations were lower with intravenous tobramycin 20.2 mg/l (interquartile range, 12 mg/l, 26.2 mg/l) versus the nebulized route 48.3 mg/l (interquartile range, 8.7 mg/l, 513 mg/l), P = 0.002. For nebulized tobramycin, the median epithelial lining fluid concentrations were higher than the interstitial space fluid concentrations at 1 h (1,637; interquartile range, 650, 1,781, vs. 16 mg/l, interquartile range, 7, 86, P &lt; 0.001) and 6 h (48, interquartile range, 17, 93, vs. 4 mg/l, interquartile range, 2, 9, P &lt; 0.001). For intravenous tobramycin, the median epithelial lining fluid concentrations were lower than the interstitial space fluid concentrations at 1 h (0.19, interquartile range, 0.11, 0.31, vs. 18.5 mg/l, interquartile range, 9.8, 23.4, P &lt; 0.001) and 6 h (0.34, interquartile range, 0.2, 0.48, vs. 3.2 mg/l, interquartile range, 0.9, 4.4, P &lt; 0.001).Compared with intravenous tobramycin, nebulized tobramycin achieved higher lung interstitial fluid and epithelial lining fluid concentrations without increasing systemic concentrations.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a frequent opportunistic infection associated with a high mortality rate. PCP is of increasing importance in non-HIV immunocompromised patients, who present with severe respiratory distress with low fungal loads. Molecular detection of Pneumocystis in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) has become an important diagnostic tool, but quantitative PCR (qPCR) needs standardization.Despite a high negative predictive value, the positive predictive value of qPCR is moderate, as it also detects colonized patients. Attempts are made to set a cut-off value of qPCR to discriminate between PCP and colonization, or to use noninvasive samples or combined strategies to increase specificity.It is easy to set a qPCR cut-off for HIV-infected patients. In non-HIV IC patients, a gain in specificity could be obtained by combining strategies, that is, qPCR on BAL and a noninvasive sample, or qPCR and serum beta-1,3-D-glucan dosage.
During July 2007-June 2015, we enrolled 4,225 hospitalized children with pneumonia in a study to determine the seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Beijing, China. We defined season as the period during which &gt;10% of total PCRs performed each week were RSV positive. We identified 8 distinctive RSV seasons. On average, the season onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October) and lasted 33 weeks, through week 20 of the next year (mid-May); 97% of all RSV-positive cases occurred during the season. RSV seasons occurred 3-5 weeks earlier and lasted &#x2248;6 weeks longer in RSV subgroup A-dominant years than in RSV subgroup B-dominant years. Our analysis indicates that monitoring such RSV subgroup shifts might provide better estimates for the onset of RSV transmission. PCR-based tests could be a flexible or complementary way of determining RSV seasonality in locations where RSV surveillance is less well-established, such as local hospitals throughout China.
We report national surveillance of Legionnaires' disease in China. Urine samples from 11 (3.85%) of 286 patients with severe pneumonia of unknown cause were positive for the Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen. We isolated Legionella strains from 7 patients. Improved diagnostic testing is needed for this underestimated disease in China.
Hinokitiol is a component of the essential oil isolated from Cupressaceae. It possesses antibacterial and antifungal activities and has been used in oral care products. In this study, we examined the antibacterial activities of hinokitiol toward various oral, nasal, and nasopharyngeal pathogenic bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, antibiotic-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The growth of all bacterial strains was significantly inhibited by hinokitiol. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of hinokitiol against S. mutans, S. sobrinus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates, antibiotic-susceptible S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes were 0.3, 1.0, 1.0, 30, 0.5, 50, 50, 30, 0.3-1.0, 0.5, and 0.3 &#x3BC;g/mL, respectively. Additionally, with the exception of P. gingivalis, hinokitiol exerted bactericidal effects against all bacterial strains at 1 h after exposure. Hinokitiol did not display any significant cytotoxicity toward the human gingival epithelial cell line Ca9-22, pharyngeal epithelial cell line Detroit 562, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human gingival fibroblasts, with the exception of 500 &#x3BC;g/mL hinokitiol treatment, which decreased viable Ca9-22 cells and gingival fibroblasts by 13% and 12%, respectively. These results suggest that hinokitiol exhibits antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria and low cytotoxicity towards human epithelial cells.
