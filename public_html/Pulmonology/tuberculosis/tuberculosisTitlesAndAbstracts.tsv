31108426	Evaluation of post-mortem diagnostic tests' sensitivity and specificity for bovine tuberculosis using Bayesian latent class analysis.	This study aimed to evaluate the performance of real-time PCR (qPCR), ELISA IDEXX&#x2122;, and bacterial isolation as post-mortem diagnostic tests in animals with lesions compatible with bovine tuberculosis detected by Brazilian Federal Inspection Service as part of the bovine tuberculosis active surveillance. Bayesian latent class models were used to estimate diagnostic tests' sensitivity, specificity, correlations, predictive values and frequency of infected animals. Samples of tuberculosis-suggestive lesions collected by FIS sanitary inspection routine in slaughterhouses from 11 Brazilian states were analyzed. Isolation was the most sensitive technique, 94.54% (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 90.09%-97.65%), qPCR was 64.69% (95% CrI 54.41%-74.15%) sensitive and ELISA IDEXX&#x2122; 26.74% (95% CrI 22.82%-30.97%). Tests' specificities were 98.19% (95% CrI 95.75%-99.45%), 93.49% (95% CrI 79.28%-99.66%), 95.53% (95% CrI 91.71%-98.02%) respectively. Despite its low sensitivity, ELISA IDEXX&#x2122; was able to identify positive samples that were not detected by the other techniques. These samples had high probability to be true positives given ELISA's positive predictive value. The correlations between qPCR and isolation were neither biologically nor statistically significant. The low sensitivity of the qPCR is a limiting factor to its use as a post-mortem diagnosis in bovine tuberculosis suggestive lesions. Its use could be recommended in situations of high prevalence, or in parallel association with other tests, such as ELISA IDEXX&#x2122;. ELISA IDDEX&#x2122; should not be used as a unique test, or in substitution of the other tests, for the post-mortem diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis due to its sensitivity.
31107741	FDG PET/CT in a Case of Bilateral Tuberculous Epididymo-orchitis.	Isolated genital tuberculosis is rare. We present a case of bilateral tuberculous epididymo-orchitis showing high FDG uptake on FDG PET/CT. In addition, the patient had a prostatic FDG-avid lesion, consistent with tuberculous prostatitis. This case indicates tuberculous epididymo-orchitis, especially in tuberculosis-endemic regions, should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with hypermetabolic epididymal or testicular lesions, including benign and malignant tumors, bacterial epididymo-orchitis, abscess, idiopathic granulomatous orchitis, and sarcoidosis.
31107249	History of tuberculosis is associated with lower exhaled nitric oxide levels in HIV-infected children.	HIV disrupts host defense mechanisms and maintains chronic inflammation in the lung. Nitric oxide (NO) is a marker of lung inflammation and can be measured in the exhaled air. We investigated the relationship between exhaled NO (eNO), HIV status and airway abnormalities in perinatally HIV-infected children aged 6 to 19 years.Cross-sectional study.HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy and HIV-uninfected children with no active tuberculosis (TB) or acute respiratory tract infection were recruited from a public hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. Clinical history was collected and eNO testing and spirometry was performed. The association between eNO and explanatory variables (HIV, FEV1 z-score, CD4 count, viral load, history of TB) was investigated using linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex and time of eNO testing.In total 222 HIV-infected and 97 HIV-uninfected participants were included. Among HIV-infected participants 57 (25.7%) had a history of past TB; 56 (25.2%) had airway obstruction, but no prior TB. HIV status was associated with lower eNO level (mean ratio 0.79 (95% CI 0.65-0.97), p&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.03). Within the HIV-infected group, history of past TB was associated with lower eNO levels after controlling for age, sex and time of eNO testing (0.79 (95% CI 0.67-0.94), p&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.007).HIV infection and history of TB were associated with lower eNO levels. eNO levels may be a marker of HIV- and TB-induced alteration in pulmonary physiology; further studies focused on potential causes for lower eNO levels in HIV and TB are warranted.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

31107224	Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Musculoskeletal Infection Cases from a Tertiary Referral Center, Colorado, USA.	Nontuberculous mycobacteria represent an uncommon but important cause of infection of the musculoskeletal system. Such infections require aggressive medical and surgical treatment, and cases are often complicated by delayed diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed all 14 nonspinal cases of nontuberculous mycobacterial musculoskeletal infections treated over 6 years by orthopedic surgeons at a university-affiliated tertiary referral center. All patients required multiple antimicrobial agents along with aggressive surgical treatment; 13 of 14 patients ultimately achieved cure. Four patients required amputation to control the infection. Half these patients were immunosuppressed by medications or other medical illness when they sought care at the referral center. Six cases involved joint prostheses; all ultimately required hardware removal and placement of an antimicrobial spacer for eradication of infection. Our findings highlight the importance of vigilance for nontuberculous mycobacterial musculoskeletal infection, particularly in patients who are immunosuppressed or have a history of musculoskeletal surgery.
31107132	Comparison of Three Cellular Immunoassays to Detect Tuberculosis Infection in 876 Healthy Recruits.	The currently purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test and 2 interferon (IFN)-&#x3B3; release assays (IGRAs) were usually used to detect  infection. We try to evaluate the performance of these methods to detect latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in this study. Each subject of the 876 recruits (19.05&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1.55, 17-24) underwent the PPD test, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). The prevalence of LTBI among the participants, as estimated by PPD, ELISPOT, and CLEIA, was 49.89% (437/876), 25.34% (222/876), and 28.77% (252/876), respectively. Of the participants, positive results were noted in 12.79% (112/876) for both ELISPOT and PPD, 19.52% (171/876) for both CLEIA and PPD; 9.82% (86/876) for 2 IGRAs; and 6.62% (58/876) for all 3 methods. Overall, the consistency among the 3 tests was 36.99% (324/876). ELISPOT-positive rate (41.38%) in the recruits with a PPD result &#x2265;20&#x2009;mm was higher than PPD &lt;20&#x2009;mm (24.76%; &#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Increased PPD skin reactions were associated with significantly increased CLEIA-positive rates and IFN-&#x3B3; levels. Of 307 recruits without the bacillus Calmette-Gu&#xE9;rin (BCG) vaccination, 2 IGRA (42.19%)-positive rates in the PPD-positive group were significantly higher than those in the PPD-negative group (28.40% and 23.05%; &#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05 and &#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01, respectively).There was low correlation and poor consistency among 2 IGRAs and PPD in healthy recruits, but IGRAs may be more accurate screening methods for TB infection in the countries with BCG vaccination.
31106941	Pulse granuloma presenting as a complex pelvic cyst.	Pulse granuloma, a benign granulomatous lesion, develops due to foreign body reactions to food particles. This rare entity occurs occasionally in the abdominal cavity. However, it has never been reported as a pelvic mass or a recurrent case. A 37-year-old woman with a medical history of pelvic granulomatous lesions treated in Thailand, was admitted for abdominal pain. Imaging study revealed a pelvic complex cyst and disseminated nodules. Ovarian cancer or tuberculous peritonitis was suspected. The appearance at laparotomy was an inflammatory mass encased in adhesions; therefore, only biopsy was performed. The pathology diagnosis was pulse granuloma. The pathology report from Thailand was obtained only after her discharge, suggesting that the previous granulomatous lesion contained vegetable matter. This report demonstrates that pulse granuloma can present as a pelvic mass and may relapse. For complex cystic lesions with solid components in the pelvis, pulse granuloma should be considered as a differential diagnosis.

31106546	[Methylation Chip Screening and Verification of Differential Genes Related to Tuberculosis Infection].	To screen the genes with significant changes in DNA methylation level in active tuberculosis patients, we used the methylation chips and expanded the sample size to verify candidate genes.&#x2460; This study enrolled 9 cases of active tuberculosis patients, 3 cases of latent tuberculosis patients and 3 cases of healthy controls whose age and gender were all matched. Genome DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cell in blood samples collected from these candidates, and bisulfite conversion treatment was then conducted. After hybridization with the Illumina HD 450K Infinium Mehtylation BeadChip, the results were compared between patients group and control group, and GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed to evaluate the function of differentially expressed genes. &#x2461; We further enrolled 60 cases of active tuberculosis patients and 60 cases of health controls (age-and gender-matched), DNA was extracted from their peripheral blood and also followed bisulfite conversion treatment. Pyrosequencing method was used to detect the methylation levels of candidate genes  screened by gene chip.Compared with healthy controls, the fragments in the patients that showed low methylation change accounted for the vast majority. Most of the methylation differential fragments (DMRs) were located in the main body region, followed by the upstream region of transcription initiation site, and the lowest DMRs distribution area was 3&#xB4;UTR area. GO and Pathway analysis showed that the functions of the differentially methylated regions related genes are mainly enriched in the biological processes of the regulation of leukocyte differentiation, apoptosis, cytokine regulation and inflammatory response which are closely related to tuberculosis. There were 32 CpG sites involved in the verified 7 tuberculosis related genes, and 16 CpG locus showed significant difference (&lt;0.05), they were distributed in 6 genes:  and Of these genes with significant difference,  genes showed hypermethylation status and  and  genes exhibited demethylation status in the patients group compared to the health controls.  and  mRNA up-regulated in the patients group compared with health controls.In the course of MTB infection, the methylation status of genomic DNA is altered, and most of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are showed status of demethylation. The expressions ofand gene up-regulate in tuberculosis infection.

31106443	1H-1,2,3-Triazole tethered isatin-moxifloxacin: Design, synthesis and in vitro anti-mycobacterial evaluation.	A series of novel 1H-1,2,3-triazole tethered isatin-moxifloxacin (MXF) hybrids 5a-l with greater lipophilicity compared with the parent MXF were designed, synthesized and screened for their in vitro antimycobacterial activities against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) H Rv and multidrug-resistant MTB (MDR-MTB) as well as their cytotoxicity on the VERO cell line. All the synthesized hybrids (MIC: 0.025-0.78 &#x3BC;g/ml) showed considerable activities against MTB H Rv and MDR-MTB, and the most active conjugate 5c (MIC: 0.025 and 0.06 &#x3BC;g/ml) was 2 to &gt;2048 times more potent in vitro than the three references MXF (MIC: 0.10 and 0.12 &#x3BC;g/ml), rifampicin (MIC: 0.39 and 32 &#x3BC;g/ml) and isoniazid (MIC: 0.05 and &gt;128 &#x3BC;g/ml) against the two tested strains. All hybrids (CC : 4-64 &#x3BC;g/ml) were much more cytotoxic than the parent MXF (CC50: 128 &#x3BC;g/ml), but the most active hybrid 5c (CC : 32 &#x3BC;g/ml) also displayed acceptable cytotoxicity, warranting further investigation.
