# WebApplications
Web Applications Project, a REST API developed in Java and Python with a website made in PHP
This project can be pasted in the home directory of a linux server with apache. After that our java and Python scripts
can be used by changing directory to the home and doing "./runProjetoAW.sh" and then you choose the field and number of diseases
and the script does retrieves diseases from that field from the dbpedia endpoint.

The folder public_html contains the html pages and php files for the website and all the files with the retrieved diseases' information.
